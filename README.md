# Javidiazdom`s Portfolio 🏀

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The scroll animations where made with [Aos package](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/). The main animation (which has not yet been done 😅) will be made with [Animejs](https://animejs.com/).

You can check the final page [here](https://javidiazdom.github.io/portfolio/).Hope you like it! x😋

In case you want to clone the repository and test the app, just run 'npm start'.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
